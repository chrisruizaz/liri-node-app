# Liri-Node-App

See the published site [here](https://chrisruizaz.github.io/liri-node-app/.)

## About

This is a Liri Bot. A lot like Siri except its Liri and awesome. This app takes a node command and looks through an API to give you information such as: Artist(s), The song's name, A preview link of the song from Spotify, The album that the song is from.

Please note that the deployed site will do nothing. You need to clone the repository and create your own dotenv package that will have your own API key from Spotify.
